# Logistic Regression with Python

Welcome to the **Logistic Regression** repository! This repository provides an in-depth look at Logistic Regression, a fundamental algorithm used for classification tasks in machine learning. Logistic Regression is commonly used when the target variable is categorical, such as predicting whether an event will happen (binary classification) or what category something belongs to (multiclass classification).
